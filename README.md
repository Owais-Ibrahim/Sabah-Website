# Sabah-Website

A quick and small project for my sister to create a porfolio website. This project was also used for my final project in my CIS-181 course and was used to demonstrate my proficiency in HTML, CSS, Github, and website development. I utilized the bootstrap framework to help build responsiveness and used advanced topics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript such as tables, animations, transitions, and complex selectors. 

This project is published via the Github system and is live at: https://owais-ibrahim.github.io/Sabah-Website/home.html.
